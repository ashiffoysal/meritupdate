                        <p>The Tutor is never paid directly. Merit Tutors manages the payments of all Tutors. The
Student/Guardian(s) will be expected to complete the tuition payments at least one
month in advance prior to the delivery of the scheduled lessons.<br>
The hourly rate of the Tutor will be made visible on the respected Tutorâ€™s profile.
Additional costs may be incurred for lesson preparation. These should be discussed with
the Tutor.</p>

which case no tuition fees will be incurred. Alternatively a catch-up session may be
arranged following mutual agreement between the two parties (Tutor and Student).
Lessons not attended by the Student without giving [24 hours] prior notice to the Tutor
shall be charged at the full rate.</p>

 <h5 style="padding:20px 10px 0px 0px">4. CANCELLATION OF LESSONS BY TUTOR</h5>
                        <p>TThe Tutor may cancel a lesson by giving [24 hours] prior notice to the Student, however,
a catch-up session will have to be arranged at a later time agreeable to both parties.</p>

                        <p>Fees are calculated according to the times stipulated in the schedule and no adjustment
shall be made for time lost because of late arrival by the Student.<br>
Any lost time because of the late arrival of the Tutor shall be compensated for by
extending a lesson by mutual agreement and by such amount of time that was lost.</p>

  <h5 style="padding:20px 10px 0px 0px">6. TERMINATION</h5>
                        <p>Where the Student wishes to terminate the tutoring sessions, they will be required to
complete a cancellation request form and provide a minimum of 14 days notice to the
Centre.</p>

event that the Student is unhappy with the tuition service provided at any point, please
email <span style="color:red">info@merittutors.co.uk</span> as soon as any issues arise. In the case of an irrevocable
break-down in the relationship between the Student and their Tutor, the assigned Tutor

Tutor is acceptable to the client.</p>
